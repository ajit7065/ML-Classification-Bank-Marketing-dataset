Problem Statement:The objective here is to apply machine learning techniques to analyse the dataset and figure out most effective tactics that will help the bank in next campaign to persuade more customers to subscribe to banks term deposit. The dataset contains various categorical and numerical features with 11162 data sample. The data is labelled. So supervised machine learning algorithms are applicable to this project. The objective is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Data pre-processing is done along with suitable exploratory data analysis. Results of various algorithms are compared at the end.

Objective: The dataset class is labelled as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ depending on whether the contacted client has subscribed to the deposit or not. It is a marketing problem and the outcome will largely influence the future strategies of bank. Banking institute has a very large client base and even larger target clients. In real world , less clients will respond positively to marketing campaign and most of them will say no. Contacting all of them is time consuming task and demands tremendous time and efforts. To manage the human resource in efficient way, it is necessary to correctly identify those clients who have more chances of saying yes. This is where machine learning comes into picture.

The classification goal is to predict if the customer will purchase a product or not.
